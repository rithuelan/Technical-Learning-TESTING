# Technical-Learning-TESTING

**1️⃣ API Testing**

Postman: Great for manual and automated API testing.

PyTest + Requests (Python): Automate API testing, validate responses, status codes, error handling.

Why important: Backend logic and data flow are core to any application. API testing ensures the “engine” works properly.

**2️⃣ Full-Stack Testing**

Unit Testing: Test small pieces of code individually (functions, classes).
Example: Checking if calculateTax() returns correct value.

Integration Testing: Test multiple modules together (API + DB).
Example: Verify a user signup API correctly stores data in the database.

End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Test the full user journey like a real user.
Example: Fill a form on the frontend → submit → verify backend stores data → confirm success message.

**3️⃣ Performance Testing**

Ensures your app/API can handle load and stress.

Tools: JMeter, Locust, Gatling.

Example: Test 1000 users hitting the login API simultaneously.

**4️⃣ Security Testing**

Ensures your app is safe from vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.

Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

Example: Try sending malicious input to your login form and check if app blocks it.

Why learning all these makes you an Automated Tester

Automation is key: You don’t test everything manually; tools/scripts do it for you.

You cover all layers: Frontend, backend, database, security, performance.

Industry-ready skills: Most companies require API automation, E2E, and performance/security testing skills.
